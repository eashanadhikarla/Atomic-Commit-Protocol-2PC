Error Recovery during two-phase commit
- If the participant fails after coompleting the phase 1, the Transaction Manager has ensures that the transaction is commited, 
by periodically attempting to commit. 

CAP Theorem:
- My project supports Consistency and Availability but not Partition-Tolerance. The reason is Consistency is achieved by 
correctly building the two phase commit protocol and Availability in my case is achieved by the AWS as I am launching my 
instances at AWS.
